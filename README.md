## 🧠 What is MaltracAI?

**MaltracAI** (Malicious Tracker AI) is a free and open-source machine learning model that classifies messages as **scam** or **not scam**.

Our mission is simple:
- 🛡️ Detect spam, scams, phishing, fraud  
- 📬 Work on SMS, emails, and eventually websites and documents  
- 💡 Make this technology freely accessible to all

---

## 🚧 Current Status

MaltracAI is under active development and currently in the **research and prototyping stage**.

At the moment:
- The model is training successfully using public datasets.
- A basic prediction interface with visualization is working locally.
- No installation packages, APIs, or UI integrations are released yet.

We're still:
- Improving the detection pipeline
- Expanding to more message formats (PDFs, web, voice)
- Preparing for public API + web integration

---

## ✨ What’s Coming Soon?

- ✅ Easy-to-use web interface  
- 🌍 Public REST API (via FastAPI or Next.js)  
- 🧪 More robust training on multilingual and real-world data  
- 📊 Dashboard to view predictions and improve accuracy

We’ve already begun collecting **real-world scam messages from Discord**.  
We're actively looking for **public data from other platforms** like Reddit, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Twitter/X to make the model more robust.

If you have access to such datasets (anonymized or public), we’d love your help!
